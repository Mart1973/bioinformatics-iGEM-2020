    "\n",
    "The term \"Monte Carlo\" refers to a [broad class of computational methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) that use random numbers to solve hard computational problems; that is, we use random numbers when there is nearly no other way to solve the problem. This is a bit counterintuitive: solving scientific problems with random numbers seems like an contradiction. As we will see, Monte Carlo is a very powerful technique across the sciences and engineering. "

    "### Monte Carlo Evaluation of an Integral\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start by writing a code to do one of the most basic tasks of calculus: finding the value of an integral. Recall that you can think of the integral of a function as the area that bounded between the function and the $x$ -axis. We will perform the integral of something for which we already know the answer so that you can check your solution analytically. The real power of Monte Carlo, or MC as it is usually referred to, in this context is in performing integrals that are vastly more complicated. In physics, for example, it is common to perform integrals in hundreds of dimensions. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will find the area of a circle using MC. You will assume that you know the area of a square and the function that defines a circle:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y = \\sqrt{1 - x^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is that you will pick a bunch of random numbers $x$ and $y$ in the square from $x \\in [0,1]$ and $y \\in [0,1]$. By seeing how many random numbers are inside the circle relative to the total, we can estimate the area of the circle (actually we're only estimating the area of $1/4$ of the circle). Another way that you can think of this as throwing darts at a dartboard. Meaning that if we throw enough darts, the area of the circle can be approximated by adding the total number of darts that hit the inside the circle. Therefore, we can get a better approximation for the area if we throw more darts. Here is a picture to help guide your thinking:\n",

    "In order to perform this Monte Carlo integration, you need to do the following (some of these are done for you in the code cell below):\n",
    "1. Set up and initialize a variable, `n_points`, that contains the number of random points you will produce. You will vary this number. As stated above, the more points, the better the approximation will be.\n",
    "2. Define counter variables, `points_in` and `points_out`, and set their initial values to be $0$. You will use these variables to store information as you generate random points.\n",
    "3. Set up a loop over the total number of points, using whatever type of Python loop you're most comfortable with.\n",
    "4. Inside the loop choose a random $(x,y)$ pair, ensuring that the pair will be somewhere in your quandrant. \n",
    "5. Using an `if` statement, check to see if you are inside the circle or not. You should be able to use the equation $y = \\sqrt{1-x^2}$ for this if statement. \n",
    "6. Update your counter variables to keep track of whether this $(x,y)$ point is inside the circle or not.\n",
    "7. Once the loop is done, `print` the area of the circle using your counter variables. The area is defined as:\n",

    "\n",
    "MC is useful for performing optmization problems as well. Optimization means pretty much what it sounds like: we want to find the optimal value for something. In fact, we have already seen this in regression: when we find the best fit of a line to some data we are optimizing the values of the parameters to make the line have the smallest distance from the data points. But, optimization can take many forms beyond this simple example. \n",

The basic problem is this: you have $N$ cities to travel between and you would like to find the shortest route, going through each city only once. This is fairly easy when $N$ is small, but becomes extremely difficult when $N$ is large - you simply cannot wait for the computer to search every possibile route. \n",
    "\n",
    "One way to attack problems of this kind is to recognize that it may be impossible to find the absolute best (most optimal) solution. It might be perfectly fine to simply have a really good solution sooner rather than never. This allows use to use MC methods: we can randomly choose different routes and see which ones are shortest; if we are clever, we can make an algorithm that attempts to get better each time it makes a new attempt. \n",

    "* **Write a function** that takes as input the number of cities, $N$.\n",
    "* For now we will not use real cities, so within the function create the locations of $N$ cities using random numbers. For convenience, you can just assume that the cities fall on a map in the range $x \\in [0,1]$ and $y \\in [0,1]$. Every city will have a random $(x,y)$ location in that range. \n",
    "* **Return** from the function the coordinates of the $N$ cities as two arrays ($x$ values and $y$ values)\n",
    "* Call the function and store those returned array in some variables. Then, Make a plot to be sure it is working.\n",

Similarly, the value at $D[5,2]$ is the distance between city 6 and city 3 (in that order). In this situation, all the distances are symmetric so as an example, $D[2,5] = D[5,2]$.\n",
