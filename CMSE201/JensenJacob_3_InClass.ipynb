    "Given all the snow that we tend to get here in Michigan, you've been thinking about playing a little prank on your roommate this winter involving a perfectly timed snowball. Fortunately, you've been learning a bit of Python and you're pretty sure that you can write a bit of code to make sure your plan goes without a hitch.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The details of your plan\n",
    "\n",
    "You plan to wait at home for your roommate to get back from class. You figure you can hideout on the porch and when you see your roommate coming, you can throw the snowball straight up in the air and duck inside so that you can watch from the window as they receive your icy surprise.\n",
    "\n",
    "This sounds like a great plan, but you realize you need to know when the snowball will land based on how fast you throw it so that you can time it just right. You're not yet sure how long it takes your roommate to get to the door from the moment when you first see them, so you figure you'll just compute several impacts times based on a range of initial snowball speeds and work out the rest of the details later."

    "Now that you've come up with your plan, you need to do a bit of digging to figure out how to compute the amount of time the snowball spends in the air based on the speed you launch it with. You spend a bit of time searching around on the internet, including Wikipedia, and you find that the important equation of motion is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h(t) = h_0 + v_0t - \\frac{1}{2}gt^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $h$ is the height of the snowball as a function of time, $h_0$ is the initial height that the snowball is launched from, $v_0$ is the initial speed the snowball is launched with, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $t$ is the time in seconds. \n",
    "\n",
    "You give it some further thought and realize what you want to know is when will the snowball land, so **when does $h(t)=0$?**\n",
    "\n",
    "You know that the initial height that the snowball is launched from, $h_0$, is roughly your height since you'll be throwing it, which we'll approximate as **1.75 meters**.\n",

    "You also recall that at some point you learned that the **acceleration due to gravity is 9.8 m/s$^2$**\n",

    "\n",
    "In general, before you start writing any code, it's good to get into the habit of coming up with a plan for how you've going to solve the problem. During this phase it is important to identify and define the variables that are revelant to the problem, the equations you're going to need to solve, and the overall structure of the program that you will write to solve the problem.\n",

    "To get some practice with this, you and your groups members are expected to **use your whiteboards** to come up with a plan of attack for computing the impact time of the snowball you're hoping to drop on the unsuspecting head of your roommate. Part of this planning process should involve a bit of what we commonly refer to as \"pseudo-code\". Pseudo-code is writing or text that follows the programmatic style of real code but doesn't necessarily have all of the proper syntax. You can think of it as an outline for how your program *should* work, before you actually start to code it up.\n",

    "3. What is a reasonable range for the snowball speeds you're going to explore?\n",

    "5. How many impact times do you plan to compute?\n",
    "6. How will you store your snowball speeds and corresponding impacts times?\n",
