As part of this effort, a survey aimed at understanding how you feel about your ability to accomplish a variety of programming-related tasks now that you've nearly completed the course is included below. You participation in this survey is completely voluntary and the results will have _absolutely no impact_ on your final grade in this course. Furthemore, your responses will be kept completely confidential. Even your instructors will not be able to identify your individual reponses.\n",
