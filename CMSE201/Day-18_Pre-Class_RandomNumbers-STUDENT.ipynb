    "**Question 6**: As we mentioned in a prior assignment, one of the interesting aspects of random number generators are that they are not **entirely** random! Think about this for a moment: computers are designed to be able to calculate very precise things with very precise instructions - how could one get randomness out of that? If the computer is following precise rules, it will only know to follow exactly those rules the next time. The way it works is that it starts with some number - _which is the seed defined above_ - and that generates a sequence; a different seed will generate a different sequence. This is very important: if you want to generate that same sequence again, you can. This means that you can make your code reproducable, which is crucial for testing and debugging your code -- often you really don't want a _truly_ random sequence! On the other hand, once you are ready to put your code in use, you can choose something like the current time to generate the seed, and that will be a new and unique sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your **goal** is to show that specifying a seed will allow you to create reproducible sequence of numbers. To do this, write a short code that uses subplots to make a 2x2 array of plots. For the subplots located at positions [0,0] and [0,1], create a histogram of 1000 random numbers using the same seed (example seed = 456). For the subplots located at positions [1,0] and [1,1], create a histogram of 1000 random numbers using the same seed but different than the first row (example seed = 789). You can use any of the random number generators of your choice (e.g. uniform). "
