One of the frontiers of research in particle and nuclear physics is to understand how fundamental particles, the gluons and quarks, determine the properties of nucleons, which are composite particles made up of quarks and gluons.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Standard Model of particle physics, quantum chromodynamics (QCD), describes how gluons strongly interact with themselves and with quarks, binding both nucleons and nuclei. Using a sufficiently large supercomputer, we can use lattice QCD to simulate a tiny volume of spacetime containing a nucleon. One output of such a simulation is a nucleon *correlator* $C_N(t)$, a real-valued function over time $t$ that asymptotically goes to the form $A e^{-M_N t}$ at large $t$. As a result, we can easily calculate the mass of the nucleon $M_N$ within our simulated universe!\n",

    "\n",
    "**Hints**: You can get a logarithm function from the math library using `import math`; the natural logarithm is called `math.log`. Use *slicing* to get the last 5 values: `list[start:stop]`; remember `list[stop]` is not included in the slice."

The half-life is a known physical property of the isotope and cannot be changed by the environment. The half-life of carbon-14 is 5,730 years.\n",

    "## Question 6: Finding beer for a beginning-of-the-semester party (5 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "Two students are organizing a beginning-of-the-semester party using beer from a new local brewery. There are 3 varieties of beer in their price range, but after tasting each variety, the students were still not sure what to bring to the party. As good former CMSE201 students, they turn to numbers to make the final call. Although taste may be subjective, stronger beer is obviously better<sup>[citation needed]</sup>, so the students agree to bring the boldest, strongest varieties available.\n",
    "\n",
    "They collected some data from the brewery to determine the ABV [alcohol by volume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_by_volume#Prediction_of_alcohol_content) of the different beers.\n",
    "Using the measurements from the brewer of the [specific gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_gravity) (SG) of the beers before and after they brewed, the students can calculate the ABV \n",
    "using the following formula:\n",
    "$$ \\text{ABV} = \\frac{1.05}{0.79} \\left(\\frac{\\text{SG}_\\text{start} - \\text{SG}_\\text{final}}{\\text{SG}_\\text{final}}\\right) \\times 100 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following cell, you're going to write a function to calculate the ABV\n",
    "for a given beer sample, rounding to 3 decimal places. Then, you're going to calculate the average ABV of each variety of beer, and pick the 2 highest-average ABV beers to bring to the party. \n",
    "\n",
    "All of the data are stored in the dictionary below called `beers`.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, write a _**function**_ that takes in a list of starting SG (SSG) and final SG (FSG) values and computes the ABV values to each of the beers and prints out the ABV list for each sample. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, write another function that calculates the average ABV for each variety and **returns** that average ABV. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, **write a loop** that loops over each beer variety in the list of lists of samples and uses your function to compute the average ABV for each variety. Your loop should include a **print statement** that prints the average ABV rounded to 3 decimals for that section, like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "`The average ABV of beer variety <variety number> is <ABV>`\n",
    "\n",
    "The variety number is the position of that variety in the list of lists, starting from the first variety being `1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The students also want to assign a category to each variety, which you should also **print out**:\n",
    "\n",
    "`This variety is <category description>`\n",
    "\n",
    "The categories are as follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the average ABV is greater than or equal to 6, the beer is `\"strong\"`.\n",
    "* If the average ABV is greater than or equal to 5 and less than 6, the beer is `\"medium\"`.\n",
    "* If the average ABV is less than 5, the beer is `\"weak\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT NOTE**: If you cannot figure out how to solve this problem using functions, do you best to complete the question without functions and you can still get the majority of the points for this problem since functions are still very new in the course."
