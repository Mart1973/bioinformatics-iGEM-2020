    "\n",
    "The general idea behind MCMC fitting of our data is that we will start from a guess at our model parameters and \"walk\" in random directions in parameter space in a way that **on average gets us closer to the best fit to the data.**  We keep track of the points that we’ve sampled over time (we call this the \"trace\" of the data), and use those to create a distribution.  The distribution shows us how likely each set of model parameters is to fit the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’re going to think about how this works using the model from our pre-class assignment as an example.\n",
    "Specifically, you’re going to revisit fitting data of the form\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "   f(x) = W x^2 + I\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "by intelligently searching for optimal $W$ and $I$ (_width_ and _intercept_ of the parabola) values. Specifically, Metropolis-Hastings fitting consists of these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with an initial guess of the model parameters, $(W_0, I_0)$.\n",
    "2. Calculate $\\chi_0^2$ for this initial guess.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the following occurs in a loop over specified number of steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Take a (potential) \"step\" from $(W_0, I_0)$ in a random direction to produce $(W_1, I_1)$\n",
    "4. Calculate the the [\"reduced chi-squared\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_chi-squared_statistic) values (as done in the pre-class), $\\chi_0^2$ and $\\chi_1^2$, for the parabolas defined by $(W_0, I_0)$ and $(W_1, I_1)$.\n",
    "5. Calculate an acceptance probability, $P = e^{-\\chi_1^2}/e^{-\\chi_0^2}$, as the ratio of two *likelihood functions* (the exponentials).\n",
    "6. Uniformly generate a random number $r \\in [0, 1)$. If $r < P$, \"accept\" $(W_1, I_1)$ as the next initial guess and assign $\\chi_0^2$=$\\chi_1^2$. Otherwise, discard $(W_1, I_1)$ and generate a new potential step from $(W_0, I_0)$.\n",
    "7. Repeat this process until you’ve generated as many points as you care to (100000 isn’t bad).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The Markov-chain part of Markov-chain Monte Carlo means \"the next step only depends on the current step.\"\n",
    "* If $\\chi_1^2 < \\chi_0^2$ (i.e. the error from $(W_1, I_1)$ is less than the error from $(W_0, I_0)$), then $P > 1$ and the new point is _always_ accepted.\n",
    "* By keeping track of the valid steps, we can chart the progress of a \"walker\" as it (hopefully!) moves towards a set of optimum values. The walker will tend to stay in the region of good fit but its wandering will inform on the range of likely values.\n",
    "* The randomness here _usually_ prevents walkers from moving in sub-optimal (higher-error) directions but occasionally allows it to happen in hopes of finding even lower error zones."
