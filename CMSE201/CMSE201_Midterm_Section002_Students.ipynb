    "\n",
    "The goal of this midterm is to give you the opportunity to test out some of the skills that you've developed thus far this semester. In particular, you'll model a sytem using ODEINT; load, manipulate, and plot data using NumPy and Matplotlib; and describe compartmental models and think about how to create one. You should find that you have all of the skills necessary to complete this exam with even just eight weeks of CMSE 201 under your belt!\n",
    "\n",
    "You are encouraged to look through the entire exam before you get started so that you can appropriately budget your time and understand the broad goals of the exam. You might want to make sure you have access to any data you need and that you can get it loaded into your notebook sooner than later, in case you run into issues. Let your instructor know right away if you have problems with accessing the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exam is set up so that even if you get stuck on one part there are opportunities to get points on the other parts, so consider jumping ahead if you feel like you aren't making progress and then come back later if you have time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important note about using online resources**: This exam is \"open internet\". That means that you can look up documentation, google how to accomplish certain Python tasks, etc. Being able to effectively use the internet for computational modeling and data science is a very important skill, so we want to make sure you have the opportunity to exercise that skill. **However, the use of any person-to-person communication software is absolutely not acceptable.** If you are seen accessing your email, using a chat program (e.g. Slack), or any sort of collaborative cloud storage or document software (e.g. Google Documents), you will be at risk for receiving a zero on the exam. You are also expected to complete the exam **without** using old notebooks from class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Keep your eyes on your screen!** Unfortunately, there isn't enough space in the room for everyone to sit at their own table so please do your best to keep your eyes on your own screen. This exam is designed to give *you* the opportunity to show the instructor what you can do and you should hold yourself accountable for maintaining a high level of academic integrity. If any of the instructors observe suspicious behavior, you will, again, risk receiving a zero."
