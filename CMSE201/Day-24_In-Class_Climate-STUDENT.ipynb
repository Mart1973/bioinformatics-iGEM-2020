    "**Note:** This is meant to be a set of simple update equations, and should *not* be solved using odeint (you don't have quite enough information to create a model that is solvable in that manner).  As an example, if you had two carbon reservoirs, R$_A$ and R$_B$, and a flux F$_{A \\rightarrow B}$ showing the amount of carbon per year that goes from reservoir A to reservoir B, the update equations would be:\n",
