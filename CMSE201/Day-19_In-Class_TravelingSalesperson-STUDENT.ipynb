    "## The Traveling Salesman Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Traveling Salesperson Problem](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) is a classic problem in computer science in the area of **optimization**.  The problem is as follows: Imagine there is a salesperson who has to travel to N cities.  The order is unimportant, as long as they only visit each city once on each trip, and finish where they started.  The salesperson wants to keep the distance traveled (and thus travel costs) as low as possible.  This problem is interesting for a variety of reasons - it applies to transportation (finding the most efficient bus routes), logistics (finding the best UPS or FedEx delivery routes for some number of packages), or in optimizing manufacturing processes to reduce cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Traveling Salesperson Problem is extremely difficult to solve for large numbers of cities - testing every possible combination of cities would take N! (N factorial) individual tests.  For 10 cities, this would require 3,628,800 separate tests.  For $20$ cities, this would require $2,432,902,008,176,640,000$ (approximately $2.4 \\times 10^{18}$) tests - if you could test one combination per microsecond ($10^{-6}$ s) it would take approximately 76,000 years!  For 30 cities, at the same rate testing every combination would take more than one billion times the age of the Universe.  As a result, this is the kind of problem where a \"good enough\" answer is sufficient, and where randomization comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good local example of a solution to the Traveling Salesperson Problem is [an optimized Michigan road trip](http://www.randalolson.com/2015/03/18/pure-michigan-road-trip-optimized/) calculated by a former MSU graduate student (and [one across the US](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/rhiever/Data-Analysis-and-Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/master/optimal-road-trip/Computing%20the%20optimal%20road%20trip%20across%20the%20U.S..ipynb)).  There's also a widely-used [software library for solving the Traveling Salesperson Problem](http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/index.html); the website has some interesting applications of the problem!\n",
    "\n",
    "This project has many steps. Read through all of the steps in advance and discuss them with your group. You might want to divide and conquer by forming sub-teams within your group. Or, simply put as many brains on each task as you can to get through each step quickly and accurately. **Use the whiteboards and the monitors to facilitate communication with your group members.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Monte Carlo (MC) Algorithm We Will Use\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to use MC to solve the Traveling Salesperson Problem. Here we will use this basic idea:\n",
    "* store an array that has a list of cities in the order that they are visited; these can be chosen randomly because we are going to search for many other orders\n",
    "* once we have that list, we will find the distance (you got a little practice with this in the pre-class assignment)\n",
    "* you will then choose randomly (this is why this is a MC method!) two cities in that list and switch them in the array, which changes the order the salesman will take, but make sure to store the old list! (you will see why)\n",
    "* now, with that new list, you find the new distance; if the new distance is less than the previous, this becomes the new order for the salesperson; if not, go back to the previous order (which is why you saved it!)\n",
    "* loop through this many times, and plot the path each time through\n",
    "* at each MC step, append to an array the current distance and plot this at the end so that you can see how the MC algorithm made progress\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm of choosing two cities in the list and swapping them is _only one_ way to do this. Below you will be asked to think of several other possibilites and try at least one of them. As you code this and think about what it is doing, you might think of better algorithms along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you get shorter and shorter distances, post your best results with your random number seed on Slack. Let's see which group has the best algorithm? (And, let's see if we all agree with each other.)"
